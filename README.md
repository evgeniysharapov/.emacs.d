# My Emacs settings

Inspired by [Emacs Rocks](http://emacsrocks.com) and
[Magnars' .emacs.d repo](https://github.com/magnars/.emacs.d).

## Setup

    cd $HOME
    git clone --recursive git://github.com/zakame/.emacs.d.git

## Notes

My Emacs settings is primarily optimized for a Perl web development
environment with Git support.  Furthermore, it has some older
customizations that come from my old `.emacs` setup for misc stuff.
